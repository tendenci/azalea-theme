# Boxes
In this theme, boxes are used for the header logo, content on the homepage, and in the footer.

## Source Code
To incorporate these boxes, copy the html from these templates and paste into the "Source Code <>" of the box.  You may need to update the image tags to reflect your site's media structure.
