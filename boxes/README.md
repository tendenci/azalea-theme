# Boxes
In this theme, boxes are used for the header logo, content on the homepage, and in the footer.

## Source Code
To incorporate these boxes, copy the html from these templates and paste into the "Source Code <>" of the box.  You may need to update the image tags to reflect your site's media structure.

## Bootstrap and Boxes
You can use the Bootstrap framework inside the boxes editors by manipulating the source code.  See Box-04 for an example.  Also, please note, while editing this box, you can use the "Source Code <>" editor to prevent accidentally deleting design elements.

For the most Bootstrap-friendly Tendenci theme, we recommend the [Willow Theme](https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci-base-theme).
