## Getting Started
If your running Tendenci on your own local machine, feel free to clone or fork the repo.
To make changes from Tendenci's browser-based Theme Editor, you can copy and paste templates.  Please note that css changes currently on your site may affect the css in this template.

## Theme Structure
This theme includes templates in accounts, events, news, forms, and jobs.  For more modern updates to other modules, check out the [Willow Theme](https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci-base-theme).

Azalea has a large, graphic header in each of the modules which relies on a default template.  In order to make an update, please be sure to include the default-xxx.html template as well as the template in the associated module folder.  Why did we do it this way?  The image from that default template can be carried throughout the module.

The custom.css file contains the styling information for this theme.  Be sure to include this css in your updates.

## Boxes Content
The Azalea theme does utilize a few boxes to provide editable content particularly in the header and footer.  Check out the Boxes folder for this content to get you started!

* Box 01 - Header Logo
* Box 02 - Homepage About Us Text (Right)
* Box 03 - Homepage About Us Image (Left)
* Box 04 - Footer
